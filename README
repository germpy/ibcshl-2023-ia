This is a project created in 2023 for the IB Computer Science HL Internal Assessment. 
It is a Java/Jswing application for users to manage their medication schedule, and relies upon saving/loading local files to preserve user data. 
Though it's not perfect, its a demonstration of my high school proficiency in Java and writing Jswing applications.
